# MessageCopy

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to copy all messages, not just text.

Here is a list that explains what copying each message will do:
- Text Message: The text content of the message (default behavior)
- Voice Message: The links to the audio asset
- Object Message: The link to the object asset
- Invite Message: In the first line it will have the Session ID, and the following lines will have join urls

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [MessageCopy.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/MessageCopy/releases/latest/download/MessageCopy.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder.
